  Mission : 
    To create a funcctional Computer representation of automated evolution.
   Computational solutions need to be developed including gene growth, and 
   mutational variation. Object based development seems to work best for the
   enviornment, but the cells themselves need more dynamic solutions. Especially
   for source of food, and symbiotic development.
